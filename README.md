## Ecommerce Admin Dashboard
Before starting my own projects, I wanted to see how experienced devs build web applications using modern technologies. So here I'm trying to follow this great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5miHyP6lExg) building an ecommerce platform.\
This repo is only the admin dashboard. Check out the [Storefront repo](https://github.com/WissemBoujlida/ecommerce-storefront).

## Getting Started
install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies used to build the project
- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind
- Shadcn-ui
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL
- Clerk

## Deployment
