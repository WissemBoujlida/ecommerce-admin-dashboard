## Ecommerce Admin Dashboard
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.\
After learning React and Next.js, I started building stuff.\
Before starting my own projects, I wanted to see how experienced devs build web applications using modern technologies.\
So here I'm trying to follow this great [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) building an ecommerce platform.\
This repo is only the admin dashboard.

## Getting Started
install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies used to build the project
- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind
- Shadcn-ui
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL
- Clerk

## Deployment
- TODO
